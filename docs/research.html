          <h3><a href="https://monarchinitiative.org/">Monarch Initiative: Disease diagnosis and discovery</a></h3>

          <p>Over the last 20 years, the genomic revolution has provided tremendous amounts of knowledge in nearly all scientific fields, especially genomic medicine. But that data is complex, exists in different forms, and is distributed across different
            locations. It can also be incomplete or conflicting, or downright overwhelming to identify what parts of available knowledge are relevant to any given question.</p>

          <p>The challenges right now are not due to lack of data--there is a huge and growing amount of data. What we lack are tools to make effective use of that data for everyone. The Monarch Initiative was recently expanded through a $10M award to establish
            a Center of Excellence in Genomic Sciences (CEGS) and develop tools to address exactly this data problem. Through the CEGS project, scientists and physicians at four institutions in the U.S. and U.K are collaborating to develop those tools.</p>

          <p>Monarch is a collaboration among members TISLab, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, The Jackson Laboratory For Genomic Medicine, RTI International, Genomics England/Queen Mary, Ada
            Health, and EMBL-EBI</p>

          <h3>Phenomics-First Resource</h3>

          <p>The human genome has been sequenced, and yet so much is unknown about what it does; what we do know is scattered across multiple, heterogeneous data sources that are difficult to integrate. The Phenomics-First Resource (PFR) coordinates the
            efforts of a large community of researchers and clinicians to help interpret the relationship between the differences (called variants) in a patient’s genome and their physical characteristics (phenotypes). We are using the emerging field
            of phenomics to improve precision medicine and innovate in evolutionary biology. Patients with rare diseases will particularly benefit from this research; it takes an average of seven years to get a diagnosis for a rare disease, and even then
            the initial diagnosis is often wrong. Phenomics can be applied in a range of fields, but in this case the researchers are primarily focused on human disease and drawing insights from laboratory organisms.</p>

          <p>The PFR will gather and unify the data from numerous sources to advance genomic interpretation in clinical settings, and will empower both researchers and clinicians to overcome long-standing barriers to discovery and patient care. This project
            forms the basis of a Center of Excellence in Genomic Science, a program of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

          <h3>Converging Genomics, Phenomics, and Environments Using Interpretable Machine Learning Models</h3>

          <p>TISLab is revolutionizing our understanding of how genes are transformed into organism traits in a changing environment. One of the central dogmas of biology is that genes and environments work together to determine the characteristics of an organism,
            or its phenotype. Yet, being able to predict with precision what an organism will look like or do based on its genes and environment has, for the most part, remained out of reach. Turns out, there’s a lot going on in a cell and in an organism
            that we just don’t understand which has a huge impact on how that organism looks and behaves. In addition to revolutionizing the way we think about how genes are expressed, we have to develop brand new ways of transforming and analyzing data
            so we can make best use of innovations in artificial intelligence and deep learning. TISLab is leading this effort to innovate in computer science and biology to combat the negative effects of climate change on public health, conservation, and
            agriculture.

          <p>TISLab is bursting through communication barriers to advance science. One of the biggest barriers to scientific advancement is lack of communication across different kinds of expertise, especially between researchers who study genetics, environmental
            science, and phenomics. This results in data that are totally incompatible with each other and blocks scientific progress. The goal of this project is to bring together a diverse range of research scientists and clinicians from these three
            areas to find ways to communicate and share data. Unified data enables new insights in relationships between diseases, genes, and environments in a wide range of species. TISLab is creating new discoveries by planning and hosting workshops for
            creating new data standards that act as a “rosetta stone” between disciplines.</p>

            TISLab is fighting pediatric cancer by supporting The Kids First Data Resource Portal, one of the largest collections of integrated genomic and clinical data for some childhood diseases, which previously were studied largely in isolation. Kids First brings
            together heterogeneous data from childhood cancers and structural birth defects to support research, study, and collaboration built on top of an unprecedented collection of genetic and phenotypic data from pediatric patients. The data in the
            Data Resource Portal is curated and structured using biomedical ontologies, including the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Mondo Disease Ontology to allow for query and retrieval of symptoms, findings and disease features across the cohorts.
            Additional work is being done in collaboration with the INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project to augment the Kids First Data Resource Center’s ability to integrate survey
            data for assessment of Down Syndrome-related clinical data and neurobehavior.

									<h3><a href="http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT/" class="logo">Annotating the CRAFT Corpus</a></h3>
									<p>The Colorado Richly Annotated Full-Text (CRAFT) Corpus is a collection of 97 full-length, open-access journal articles from the biomedical literature that are manually annotated, for use as gold-standard resources for the training and testing of biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Within these articles, each mention of the concepts explicitly represented in eight prominent Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs) has been annotated, resulting in gold-standard markup of genes and gene products, chemicals and molecular entities, biomacromolecular sequence features, cells and cellular and extracellular components and locations, organisms, biological processes and molecular functionalities. With these ~100,000 concept annotations among the ~800,000 words in the 67 articles of the 1.0 release, it is one of the largest gold-standard biomedical semantically annotated corpora. In addition to this substantial conceptual markup, the corpus is fully annotated along a number of syntactic and other axes, notably by sentence segmentation, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, text formatting, and document sectioning. Current efforts are underway to add new annotations. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#433522302a2f263530032c2b30366d262736">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a><br><br>

									<h3>CTAR</h3>
									<p>The Clinical and Translational Activity Reporting (CTAR) tool was a collaboration Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute and the OHSU Library's Ontology Development Group to prototype tool that would collocate and analyze data about research activities across a disparate set of internal and external databases (e.g. IRB, grants and contracts, PubMed). Leveraging MeSH, other terminologies, and simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the CTAR prototype identified research activity topics and trends, and their classification as clinical or translational. The tool was intended to increase the OHSU's and the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute's ability to strategically contribute to research outcomes and human health. <b>Contact:  </b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48981888d979785a4908d97888586ca8b9683">Melissa Haendel</a>.</p>

									<h3><a href="http://ctsaconnect.org/" class="logo">CTSAconnect</a></h3>
									<p>The CTSAconnect project aimed to integrate information about research activities, clinical activities, and scientific resources by creating an Integrated Semantic Framework (ontology). This new framework facilitated the production and consumption of Linked Open Data (a Semantic Web method of sharing data) about investigators, physicians, biomedical research resources, services, and clinical activities. The goal was to enable software to consume data from multiple sources and allow the broadest possible representation of researchers' and clinicians' activities and research products. Current research tracking and networking systems rely largely on publications, but clinical encounters, reagents, techniques, specimens, model organisms, etc., are equally valuable for representing expertise. CTSAconnect was a collaboration between members at OHSU, Stony Brook University, Cornell University, Harvard University, University at Buffalo, and the University of Florida, and leveraged the work of eagle-i, VIVO, and ShareCenter.  <b>Contact:</b> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a7c6b7963666f7c794a6562797f246f6e7f">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a><br><br>

									<h3><a href="https://www.force11.org/group/resource-identification-initiative" class="logo">Resource Identification Initiative</a></h3>
									<p>The Resource Identification Initiative (#RII) was designed to help researchers sufficiently cite the key resources used to produce the scientific findings reported in the biomedical literature. The project aimed to enable resource identification within the biomedical literature through a pilot study promoting the use of unique Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs). In addition to being unique, RRID’s meet three key criteria, they are: 1) Machine readable; 2) Free to generate and access; 3) Consistent across publishers and journals. A diverse group of collaborators led the project, including the Neuroscience Information Framework and the OHSU Library. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e382f3d27222b383d0e21263d3b602b2a3b">Nicole Vasilevsky.</a></p>

									<h3>Biospecimen Query</h3>
									<p>This project explored options for enhancing search capabilities for an existing biospecimen search application. Text processing tools were used to map anatomy, pathology, and disease concepts from existing terminologies and ontologies to pathology reports that are currently represented in an unstructured natural text form. The concepts identified in the text were also organized in a relational structure to enable taxonomic and parthood based searches. This was a small exploratory project with a goal of integrating these capabilities in an ongoing effort to expand and integrate OHSU's biospecimen databases. <b>Contact:</b> <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2e434b42475d5d4f6e5a475d424f4c00415c49">Melissa Haendel.</a><br><br>
